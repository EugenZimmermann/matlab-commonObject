Collection of "object" functions for all my matlab programs https://github.com/EugenZimmermann

Place on same level as program folders, i.e.:

- Matlab
- Matlab/CommonObject
- Matlab/CommonObject/CommonObjectFunctionX.m
- Matlab/ProgramY
- Matlab/ProgramY/MainProgramY.m

Mandatory additional folders are:
- *CommonGUI* https://github.com/EugenZimmermann/matlab-commonGUI

Due to a significant change in graphics handling with Matlab 2014b this program is NOT COMPATIBLE TO MATLAB 2014a AND BELOW.
